Men233ndez and here in Feasible I share my personal views on how Operations Research impacts our day to day businesses or society128200 Operations Research reimagined Part III mindsetThere exist a transparency issue lets fix itBorja Men233ndezNov 24nbspREAD IN APPnbspListen to post 2022Today8217s post is sponsored by8230The DecisionOps platform helping optimization teams build more decision models instead of more decision tools128073 Do you want to sponsor a post innbspFeasible Just reply to this emailA paradox exists in analytical solutions while Machine Learning and Operations Research aim to drive better decisions they take radically different approaches to transparencyOR holds a distinct advantage in terms of algorithmic clarityOur mathematical models state their objectives and constraints providing a clear path to understanding solutions Even in complex scenarios the logic remains traceable8212sometimes difficult to follow but fundamentally comprehensibleContrast this with MLs opaque algorithms Neural Networks and Transformers make decisions through complex layers that resist straightforward interpretation While explainability tools exist they require additional trust in their mechanismsHowever when we examine organizational culture and knowledgesharing practices the situation reverses dramaticallyML thrives in an opensource ecosystem where leading tools are freely available and communitydriven innovation is the norm This transparency has accelerated adoption with decisionmakers comfortable implementing ML solutionsOR remains bound to proprietary approaches The mathematical clarity of our solutions is hidden behind closed software and proprietary implementations limiting the fields accessibility and adoption128204 Why does this matter nowThis transparency gap isnt just an academic concern Its shaping the future of business analytics129488 Organizations are demanding explainable accessible solutions1281058205128187 The next generation of analysts and developers expect open tools and communities128176 Companies are making multimillion dollar decisions between OR and ML approaches128214 The rise of AI has made transparency essential for solution adoption1293358205979465039 The OR talent gap is widening while ML attracts new practitioners dailyUnderstanding this disconnect and its implications for ORs future is crucialIn todays Feasible edition well explore128373650398205979465039 The impact of ORs transparency issue128220 How historical decisions shaped our closed ecosystem128161 What we can learn from MLs transparent approachThis is the third post in a sixpart series on the issues that have prevented OR from reaching its full potential and help you avoid these patterns If you missed them read Part I and Part II127911 At the top you can listen to a podcastlike version of this post8594 Ready to dive into ORs transparency challenge Lets get started The problem with the lack of transparencyTrust is fundamental to adopting any analytical solutionIn Operations Research trust is critical because our solutions drive significant business decisions Yet our field often operates behind a veil of opacity that undermines this trustWhile OR prides itself on mathematical precision and optimal solutions the path to these solutions often remains hiddenProprietary solvers obscure their algorithms behind simplified interfaces creating a black box that decisionmakers struggle to trust This opacity creates a paradox we offer precise deterministic solutions but conceal the reasoning that makes them reliableAn interesting contrast emerges when comparing OR and Machine LearningWhile ML algorithms are more opaque in their decisionmaking they face less resistance in adoption The key lies in expectation managementML practitioners acknowledge the probabilistic nature of their solutions and have developed robust tools for decision explanation Meanwhile ORs promise of deterministic optimality creates higher expectations for solution transparencyThis lack of transparency manifests in several critical ways859665039 Misalignment between model recommendations and organizational strategy1285818205979465039 Executive hesitation in implementing solutions they dont understand128679 Barriers in stakeholder communication and buyin Challenges in crossfunctional collaborationOR practitioners face a dual communication burden They must translate business problems into mathematical models and explain complex solutions to stakeholders This challenge becomes harder when tools and methods lack transparencyUnderstanding how we arrived at this opacity is crucial for charting a path forward The historical development of OR has created structural barriers to transparency and recognizing these is the first step toward dismantling themHow did we get here128220 Historical reasonsThe foundations of modern ORs transparency challenges were laid during its golden age of software development 1980s1990s This period saw the emergence of powerful but closed systems that shaped the fields culture for decadesProprietary enterprisegrade solutions dominated the landscape across multiple domainsOptimization Solvers CPLEX FICO Xpress are powerful and complex environments that set the standard for opaque solutionsSimulation Tools SIMANArena Sophisticated but closed systems for process modelingDecision Support Systems Expert Choice are proprietary frameworks with undisclosed methodologiesSupply Chain Solutions i2 Technologies Industryspecific tools with embedded OR techniques in opaque interfacesSeveral interconnected factors reinforced this closed ecosystem128184 Economic realities those companies had high development costs so they needed to charge premium prices Limited market competition enabled exclusive business models128190 Technological context sharing software was harder then due to limited access to public repositories It was possible but impractical Computational constraints favored optimized closed implementations and hardware limitations made efficient proprietary solutions more viable Given the high computational complexities of OR solutions you need machines with i good CPU and ii good RAM Those are expensive128257 Academic vs industry both worlds have different incentive structures Universities need to publish papers and the more complicated the better while businesses prioritize practical implementation and simple solutions are often better Academic research incentives favored theoretical publications over opensource tools while enterprise software models prioritized exclusive highmargin solutions All of this contributes to limited transfer mechanisms between academia and industry12796365039 Cultural evolution OR professionals viewed methodological complexity as a competitive advantage It uses highly mathematical notation that sets another entry barrier Since each industry has its own optimization problems and almost every business has unique constraints OR is a fragmented field making genericpurpose software less appealingThis historical development had lasting consequences It delayed the democratization of OR tools reduced crossdisciplinary collaboration and slowed innovation compared to open fieldsWhile OR remained in its closed ecosystem ML evolved differentlyCan we learn from Machine Learning and restart Operations Research to make it greater than ever128161 Learning from Machine Learning a blueprint for transparencyMachine Learnings transparencyfirst approach offers valuable lessons for Operations ResearchWhile ML faces algorithmic opacity challenges the field has cultivated a culture of openness that drives innovation and adoptionI see three pillars of ML transparency128275 Open knowledge ecosystemThe codesharing culture with public repositories drives open research and a preprint culture for topnotch work on arXivThat opens a reproducible research environment with standard datasets and evaluation metricsPeer reviews go beyond traditional channels due to a communitydriven process129309 Democratized innovationYou can visit GitHub to find countless opensource repositories of tools like PyTorch TensorFlow or scikitlearn and educational resources like free courses tutorials and documentationThose platforms offer a discussion forum like GitHub Discussions for users to discuss important development tasks This fosters collaborative development128269 Transparency technologiesThough you may struggle to understand why a model gave a particular solution decision explanation tools like SHAP and LIME can helpThere are visualization tools like TensorBoard and Weights amp Biases to visualize the training process and final weights applicationAn ecosystem of tools like MLflow or Kubeflow helps manage the entire ML cycle including tracking experiments packaging code into reproducible runs and sharing and deploying models8594 The transformation of OR doesnt require abandoning its mathematical rigor or unique strengths Instead we can128207 Maintain precision while improving accessibility127891 Preserve expertise while broadening participation127981 Keep industrial applications while sharing general approaches128220 Honor historical contributions while embracing modern practicesWe can create a more vibrant accessible and innovative field by adopting MLs transparency practices while preserving ORs core strengths127937 Some conclusionsThe path forward is clear Operations Research must embrace transparency to reach its full potentialBut this transformation promises more than openness It offers a fundamental reimagining of how OR can drive business valueKey benefits of a transparent OR ecosystem128640 Accelerated innovation through opensource collaboration speeds development cycles and crosspollinates ideas This accelerates problemsolving through shared knowledge127775 Talent development and attraction to lower barriers for new practitioners with clear learning paths for aspiring OR professionals129309 Enhanced trust and adoption with a clearer value proposition for decisionmakers better stakeholder understanding of solutions and increased implementation confidence This resulted in stronger alignment with modern business practices127942 Competitive advantage with faster deployment of optimization solutions and greater adaptability to new tech stacksThe transformation of OR is essential for the fields futureJoin the movement128214 Share your transparency success stories128187 Contribute to opensource OR

edition of AlphaSignal a newsletter for developers by developers IN TODAYS SIGNAL Read time min secWeve partnered with Encord a powerful multimodal AI data platform to bring you expert insights on how to beat AI scaling laws with highquality data Encord specializes in transforming large unstructured datasets into highquality annotated data for training and finetuning models You will learn How to beat AI scaling laws with highquality data Example Lessons from Metas SAM Data Engine Practical Guide how to balance data workflow automation with humanintheloop verification How to use Encord to curate and annotate highquality datasets Who is Encord Encord is a multimodal AI data management curation and annotation workflow platform that enables teams to efficiently transform petabytes of unstructured data such as images videos audio document and text files into highquality datasets for training finetuning and aligning AI models and applicationsKey features Cloud data unification manage and curate petabytes of multimodal data across AWS GCP and Azure with granular metadata and quality metric filtering Data visualization use highdimensional embeddings plots to curate highquality datasets by detecting data imbalances and outliers and embeddingsbased natural language search Data workflow automation integrate StateoftheArt models or your own models directly into data workflows to automate any data action such as large scale sorting review prelabeling and classification Customizable annotation layouts analyze and annotate multiple data modalities in a single interface Edge case prioritization use active learning to evaluate model performance and finetuning TRY ENCORD TRY ENCORD How to beat scaling laws with highquality data AI scaling laws predict that model performance follows a power law relationship with dataset size Performance dataset sizea describes how model error decreases as you add more training data where a is the scaling exponent typically around In practice for a dataset of items and error To achieve error half you need samples 4x To achieve error quarter you need samples 16x To achieve error onetenth you need samples 100x This exponential growth in dataset size for marginal linear performance improvements shows why building productiongrade AI applications is so challenging Research has shown that AI teams spend approximately of their time on data preparation leaving only for actual model development and deployment This imbalance becomes more pronounced as data volumes scale into the millions of files across multiple modalities A new perspectiveResearch from Beyond Neural Scaling Laws reveals that strategically preparing a diverse wellbalanced smaller dataset from a largescale raw data can achieve exponential improvements Error eb dataset sizewhere b depends on the data selection strategy This means A carefully curated dataset of examples might outperform a random dataset of The key lies in identifying which examples provide the most information gain AI performance scaling laws can be manipulated with highquality data When the data used to train and finetune AI models undergoes rigorous curation including deduplication noise reduction and domainrelevance filtering models can extract stronger learning signals from each data example This enhanced signaltonoise ratio leads to steeper learning curves and better asymptotic performance effectively shifting the entire scaling curve upward Research shows that with highquality datasets models can achieve the same results with just of the raw data volume This quality multiplier effect also reduces interference between data examples helping models build more generalizable representations The resulting improvements in sample efficiency can dramatically reduce computational costs but also increases model reliability and robustness Data Engines Architecture amp Implementation Lets look at how leading research teams are building efficient data engines to prepare the ideal dataset to build highperforming AI applications in the most costeffective and efficient way possibleMetas approach building a threestage data engineStep AssistedManual Stage Human annotators and model assistance used for bootstrapping initial data Quality focus seconds per annotation The first stage involves assistedmanual annotation where human annotators utilize SAM itself to interactively label object masks This approach leverages the models capabilities to accelerate the annotation process allowing annotators to quickly generate masks with minimal input Step SemiAutomatic Stage Model generates initial proposals and human refinement only where needed 51x speed improvement seconds per annotation The second stage transitions to semiautomatic mask generation where the model proposes masks based on a grid of points provided as prompts and annotators refine these proposals as needed This stage further increases the efficiency of data creation while maintaining high annotation quality Step Fully Automatic Stage Modeldriven generation and automated quality filters 84x faster than manual seconds per annotation Finally the third stage utilizes the model to automatically generate masks without human input This fully automatic stage leverages the models learned knowledge to generate a vast quantity of masks significantly increasing the datasets scale and diversity How to design a data engine for building highquality datasets The goal is to maximize the information density per training token which often means using a smaller cleaner dataset rather than simply gathering more data With current approaches transforming petabytes of raw unstructured data into highquality datasets remains a manual and timeconsuming problem The optimal approach to preparing highquality datasets at scale lies in constructing a data engine that combines multiple layers of automation with human oversightFirst pass automation Use lightweight models for initial filtering and basic annotation Deploy parallel processing pipelines for different modalities Foundation model layer Reserve expensive foundation models for complex annotations and use smaller specialized models where possible Implement batch processing to optimize compute utilization HumanintheLoop verification Focus human attention on high uncertainty and edge cases Implement active learning to strategically select the most informative samples for annotation Quality assurance Regular sampling and verification of automated annotations Crossvalidation across different annotators and continuous monitoring of annotation consistency The costquality tradeoff The use of foundation models for automated annotation presents a complex costbenefit equation While capable of processing millions of data items in a fraction of the time foundation model usage costs can be substantial A typical GPT4 based annotation pipeline processing millions of data items can cost thousands of dollars per day However the alternative of pure human annotation also becomes prohibitively expensive and timeconsuming at scale Building a data engine that balances targeted automation with humanintheloop verification and lighter model integration for data curation and annotation will improve data quality while reducing dataset size to achieve better model performance in a more cost effective and efficient way EncordEncord offers a multimodal AI data platform for teams to transform fragmented largescale unstructured data into highquality datasets through automated data curation and annotation on one single platform Efficiently set up streamlined data workflows and integrate StateoftheArt models to automate and accelerate data preparation whilst also conducting

Men233ndez and here in Feasible I share my personal views on how Operations Research impacts our day to day businesses or society128200 Operations Research reimagined Part III mindsetThere exist a transparency issue lets fix itBorja Men233ndezNov 24nbspREAD IN APPnbspListen to post 2022Today8217s post is sponsored by8230The DecisionOps platform helping optimization teams build more decision models instead of more decision tools128073 Do you want to sponsor a post innbspFeasible Just reply to this emailA paradox exists in analytical solutions while Machine Learning and Operations Research aim to drive better decisions they take radically different approaches to transparencyOR holds a distinct advantage in terms of algorithmic clarityOur mathematical models state their objectives and constraints providing a clear path to understanding solutions Even in complex scenarios the logic remains traceable8212sometimes difficult to follow but fundamentally comprehensibleContrast this with MLs opaque algorithms Neural Networks and Transformers make decisions through complex layers that resist straightforward interpretation While explainability tools exist they require additional trust in their mechanismsHowever when we examine organizational culture and knowledgesharing practices the situation reverses dramaticallyML thrives in an opensource ecosystem where leading tools are freely available and communitydriven innovation is the norm This transparency has accelerated adoption with decisionmakers comfortable implementing ML solutionsOR remains bound to proprietary approaches The mathematical clarity of our solutions is hidden behind closed software and proprietary implementations limiting the fields accessibility and adoption128204 Why does this matter nowThis transparency gap isnt just an academic concern Its shaping the future of business analytics129488 Organizations are demanding explainable accessible solutions1281058205128187 The next generation of analysts and developers expect open tools and communities128176 Companies are making multimillion dollar decisions between OR and ML approaches128214 The rise of AI has made transparency essential for solution adoption1293358205979465039 The OR talent gap is widening while ML attracts new practitioners dailyUnderstanding this disconnect and its implications for ORs future is crucialIn todays Feasible edition well explore128373650398205979465039 The impact of ORs transparency issue128220 How historical decisions shaped our closed ecosystem128161 What we can learn from MLs transparent approachThis is the third post in a sixpart series on the issues that have prevented OR from reaching its full potential and help you avoid these patterns If you missed them read Part I and Part II127911 At the top you can listen to a podcastlike version of this post8594 Ready to dive into ORs transparency challenge Lets get started The problem with the lack of transparencyTrust is fundamental to adopting any analytical solutionIn Operations Research trust is critical because our solutions drive significant business decisions Yet our field often operates behind a veil of opacity that undermines this trustWhile OR prides itself on mathematical precision and optimal solutions the path to these solutions often remains hiddenProprietary solvers obscure their algorithms behind simplified interfaces creating a black box that decisionmakers struggle to trust This opacity creates a paradox we offer precise deterministic solutions but conceal the reasoning that makes them reliableAn interesting contrast emerges when comparing OR and Machine LearningWhile ML algorithms are more opaque in their decisionmaking they face less resistance in adoption The key lies in expectation managementML practitioners acknowledge the probabilistic nature of their solutions and have developed robust tools for decision explanation Meanwhile ORs promise of deterministic optimality creates higher expectations for solution transparencyThis lack of transparency manifests in several critical ways859665039 Misalignment between model recommendations and organizational strategy1285818205979465039 Executive hesitation in implementing solutions they dont understand128679 Barriers in stakeholder communication and buyin Challenges in crossfunctional collaborationOR practitioners face a dual communication burden They must translate business problems into mathematical models and explain complex solutions to stakeholders This challenge becomes harder when tools and methods lack transparencyUnderstanding how we arrived at this opacity is crucial for charting a path forward The historical development of OR has created structural barriers to transparency and recognizing these is the first step toward dismantling themHow did we get here128220 Historical reasonsThe foundations of modern ORs transparency challenges were laid during its golden age of software development 1980s1990s This period saw the emergence of powerful but closed systems that shaped the fields culture for decadesProprietary enterprisegrade solutions dominated the landscape across multiple domainsOptimization Solvers CPLEX FICO Xpress are powerful and complex environments that set the standard for opaque solutionsSimulation Tools SIMANArena Sophisticated but closed systems for process modelingDecision Support Systems Expert Choice are proprietary frameworks with undisclosed methodologiesSupply Chain Solutions i2 Technologies Industryspecific tools with embedded OR techniques in opaque interfacesSeveral interconnected factors reinforced this closed ecosystem128184 Economic realities those companies had high development costs so they needed to charge premium prices Limited market competition enabled exclusive business models128190 Technological context sharing software was harder then due to limited access to public repositories It was possible but impractical Computational constraints favored optimized closed implementations and hardware limitations made efficient proprietary solutions more viable Given the high computational complexities of OR solutions you need machines with i good CPU and ii good RAM Those are expensive128257 Academic vs industry both worlds have different incentive structures Universities need to publish papers and the more complicated the better while businesses prioritize practical implementation and simple solutions are often better Academic research incentives favored theoretical publications over opensource tools while enterprise software models prioritized exclusive highmargin solutions All of this contributes to limited transfer mechanisms between academia and industry12796365039 Cultural evolution OR professionals viewed methodological complexity as a competitive advantage It uses highly mathematical notation that sets another entry barrier Since each industry has its own optimization problems and almost every business has unique constraints OR is a fragmented field making genericpurpose software less appealingThis historical development had lasting consequences It delayed the democratization of OR tools reduced crossdisciplinary collaboration and slowed innovation compared to open fieldsWhile OR remained in its closed ecosystem ML evolved differentlyCan we learn from Machine Learning and restart Operations Research to make it greater than ever128161 Learning from Machine Learning a blueprint for transparencyMachine Learnings transparencyfirst approach offers valuable lessons for Operations ResearchWhile ML faces algorithmic opacity challenges the field has cultivated a culture of openness that drives innovation and adoptionI see three pillars of ML transparency128275 Open knowledge ecosystemThe codesharing culture with public repositories drives open research and a preprint culture for topnotch work on arXivThat opens a reproducible research environment with standard datasets and evaluation metricsPeer reviews go beyond traditional channels due to a communitydriven process129309 Democratized innovationYou can visit GitHub to find countless opensource repositories of tools like PyTorch TensorFlow or scikitlearn and educational resources like free courses tutorials and documentationThose platforms offer a discussion forum like GitHub Discussions for users to discuss important development tasks This fosters collaborative development128269 Transparency technologiesThough you may struggle to understand why a model gave a particular solution decision explanation tools like SHAP and LIME can helpThere are visualization tools like TensorBoard and Weights amp Biases to visualize the training process and final weights applicationAn ecosystem of tools like MLflow or Kubeflow helps manage the entire ML cycle including tracking experiments packaging code into reproducible runs and sharing and deploying models8594 The transformation of OR doesnt require abandoning its mathematical rigor or unique strengths Instead we can128207 Maintain precision while improving accessibility127891 Preserve expertise while broadening participation127981 Keep industrial applications while sharing general approaches128220 Honor historical contributions while embracing modern practicesWe can create a more vibrant accessible and innovative field by adopting MLs transparency practices while preserving ORs core strengths127937 Some conclusionsThe path forward is clear Operations Research must embrace transparency to reach its full potentialBut this transformation promises more than openness It offers a fundamental reimagining of how OR can drive business valueKey benefits of a transparent OR ecosystem128640 Accelerated innovation through opensource collaboration speeds development cycles and crosspollinates ideas This accelerates problemsolving through shared knowledge127775 Talent development and attraction to lower barriers for new practitioners with clear learning paths for aspiring OR professionals129309 Enhanced trust and adoption with a clearer value proposition for decisionmakers better stakeholder understanding of solutions and increased implementation confidence This resulted in stronger alignment with modern business practices127942 Competitive advantage with faster deployment of optimization solutions and greater adaptability to new tech stacksThe transformation of OR is essential for the fields futureJoin the movement128214 Share your transparency success stories128187 Contribute to opensource OR

edition of AlphaSignal a newsletter for developers by developers IN TODAYS SIGNAL Read time min secWeve partnered with Encord a powerful multimodal AI data platform to bring you expert insights on how to beat AI scaling laws with highquality data Encord specializes in transforming large unstructured datasets into highquality annotated data for training and finetuning models You will learn How to beat AI scaling laws with highquality data Example Lessons from Metas SAM Data Engine Practical Guide how to balance data workflow automation with humanintheloop verification How to use Encord to curate and annotate highquality datasets Who is Encord Encord is a multimodal AI data management curation and annotation workflow platform that enables teams to efficiently transform petabytes of unstructured data such as images videos audio document and text files into highquality datasets for training finetuning and aligning AI models and applicationsKey features Cloud data unification manage and curate petabytes of multimodal data across AWS GCP and Azure with granular metadata and quality metric filtering Data visualization use highdimensional embeddings plots to curate highquality datasets by detecting data imbalances and outliers and embeddingsbased natural language search Data workflow automation integrate StateoftheArt models or your own models directly into data workflows to automate any data action such as large scale sorting review prelabeling and classification Customizable annotation layouts analyze and annotate multiple data modalities in a single interface Edge case prioritization use active learning to evaluate model performance and finetuning TRY ENCORD TRY ENCORD How to beat scaling laws with highquality data AI scaling laws predict that model performance follows a power law relationship with dataset size Performance dataset sizea describes how model error decreases as you add more training data where a is the scaling exponent typically around In practice for a dataset of items and error To achieve error half you need samples 4x To achieve error quarter you need samples 16x To achieve error onetenth you need samples 100x This exponential growth in dataset size for marginal linear performance improvements shows why building productiongrade AI applications is so challenging Research has shown that AI teams spend approximately of their time on data preparation leaving only for actual model development and deployment This imbalance becomes more pronounced as data volumes scale into the millions of files across multiple modalities A new perspectiveResearch from Beyond Neural Scaling Laws reveals that strategically preparing a diverse wellbalanced smaller dataset from a largescale raw data can achieve exponential improvements Error eb dataset sizewhere b depends on the data selection strategy This means A carefully curated dataset of examples might outperform a random dataset of The key lies in identifying which examples provide the most information gain AI performance scaling laws can be manipulated with highquality data When the data used to train and finetune AI models undergoes rigorous curation including deduplication noise reduction and domainrelevance filtering models can extract stronger learning signals from each data example This enhanced signaltonoise ratio leads to steeper learning curves and better asymptotic performance effectively shifting the entire scaling curve upward Research shows that with highquality datasets models can achieve the same results with just of the raw data volume This quality multiplier effect also reduces interference between data examples helping models build more generalizable representations The resulting improvements in sample efficiency can dramatically reduce computational costs but also increases model reliability and robustness Data Engines Architecture amp Implementation Lets look at how leading research teams are building efficient data engines to prepare the ideal dataset to build highperforming AI applications in the most costeffective and efficient way possibleMetas approach building a threestage data engineStep AssistedManual Stage Human annotators and model assistance used for bootstrapping initial data Quality focus seconds per annotation The first stage involves assistedmanual annotation where human annotators utilize SAM itself to interactively label object masks This approach leverages the models capabilities to accelerate the annotation process allowing annotators to quickly generate masks with minimal input Step SemiAutomatic Stage Model generates initial proposals and human refinement only where needed 51x speed improvement seconds per annotation The second stage transitions to semiautomatic mask generation where the model proposes masks based on a grid of points provided as prompts and annotators refine these proposals as needed This stage further increases the efficiency of data creation while maintaining high annotation quality Step Fully Automatic Stage Modeldriven generation and automated quality filters 84x faster than manual seconds per annotation Finally the third stage utilizes the model to automatically generate masks without human input This fully automatic stage leverages the models learned knowledge to generate a vast quantity of masks significantly increasing the datasets scale and diversity How to design a data engine for building highquality datasets The goal is to maximize the information density per training token which often means using a smaller cleaner dataset rather than simply gathering more data With current approaches transforming petabytes of raw unstructured data into highquality datasets remains a manual and timeconsuming problem The optimal approach to preparing highquality datasets at scale lies in constructing a data engine that combines multiple layers of automation with human oversightFirst pass automation Use lightweight models for initial filtering and basic annotation Deploy parallel processing pipelines for different modalities Foundation model layer Reserve expensive foundation models for complex annotations and use smaller specialized models where possible Implement batch processing to optimize compute utilization HumanintheLoop verification Focus human attention on high uncertainty and edge cases Implement active learning to strategically select the most informative samples for annotation Quality assurance Regular sampling and verification of automated annotations Crossvalidation across different annotators and continuous monitoring of annotation consistency The costquality tradeoff The use of foundation models for automated annotation presents a complex costbenefit equation While capable of processing millions of data items in a fraction of the time foundation model usage costs can be substantial A typical GPT4 based annotation pipeline processing millions of data items can cost thousands of dollars per day However the alternative of pure human annotation also becomes prohibitively expensive and timeconsuming at scale Building a data engine that balances targeted automation with humanintheloop verification and lighter model integration for data curation and annotation will improve data quality while reducing dataset size to achieve better model performance in a more cost effective and efficient way EncordEncord offers a multimodal AI data platform for teams to transform fragmented largescale unstructured data into highquality datasets through automated data curation and annotation on one single platform Efficiently set up streamlined data workflows and integrate StateoftheArt models to automate and accelerate data preparation whilst also conducting

Men233ndez and here in Feasible I share my personal views on how Operations Research impacts our day to day businesses or society128200 Operations Research reimagined Part III mindsetThere exist a transparency issue lets fix itBorja Men233ndezNov 24nbspREAD IN APPnbspListen to post 2022Today8217s post is sponsored by8230The DecisionOps platform helping optimization teams build more decision models instead of more decision tools128073 Do you want to sponsor a post innbspFeasible Just reply to this emailA paradox exists in analytical solutions while Machine Learning and Operations Research aim to drive better decisions they take radically different approaches to transparencyOR holds a distinct advantage in terms of algorithmic clarityOur mathematical models state their objectives and constraints providing a clear path to understanding solutions Even in complex scenarios the logic remains traceable8212sometimes difficult to follow but fundamentally comprehensibleContrast this with MLs opaque algorithms Neural Networks and Transformers make decisions through complex layers that resist straightforward interpretation While explainability tools exist they require additional trust in their mechanismsHowever when we examine organizational culture and knowledgesharing practices the situation reverses dramaticallyML thrives in an opensource ecosystem where leading tools are freely available and communitydriven innovation is the norm This transparency has accelerated adoption with decisionmakers comfortable implementing ML solutionsOR remains bound to proprietary approaches The mathematical clarity of our solutions is hidden behind closed software and proprietary implementations limiting the fields accessibility and adoption128204 Why does this matter nowThis transparency gap isnt just an academic concern Its shaping the future of business analytics129488 Organizations are demanding explainable accessible solutions1281058205128187 The next generation of analysts and developers expect open tools and communities128176 Companies are making multimillion dollar decisions between OR and ML approaches128214 The rise of AI has made transparency essential for solution adoption1293358205979465039 The OR talent gap is widening while ML attracts new practitioners dailyUnderstanding this disconnect and its implications for ORs future is crucialIn todays Feasible edition well explore128373650398205979465039 The impact of ORs transparency issue128220 How historical decisions shaped our closed ecosystem128161 What we can learn from MLs transparent approachThis is the third post in a sixpart series on the issues that have prevented OR from reaching its full potential and help you avoid these patterns If you missed them read Part I and Part II127911 At the top you can listen to a podcastlike version of this post8594 Ready to dive into ORs transparency challenge Lets get started The problem with the lack of transparencyTrust is fundamental to adopting any analytical solutionIn Operations Research trust is critical because our solutions drive significant business decisions Yet our field often operates behind a veil of opacity that undermines this trustWhile OR prides itself on mathematical precision and optimal solutions the path to these solutions often remains hiddenProprietary solvers obscure their algorithms behind simplified interfaces creating a black box that decisionmakers struggle to trust This opacity creates a paradox we offer precise deterministic solutions but conceal the reasoning that makes them reliableAn interesting contrast emerges when comparing OR and Machine LearningWhile ML algorithms are more opaque in their decisionmaking they face less resistance in adoption The key lies in expectation managementML practitioners acknowledge the probabilistic nature of their solutions and have developed robust tools for decision explanation Meanwhile ORs promise of deterministic optimality creates higher expectations for solution transparencyThis lack of transparency manifests in several critical ways859665039 Misalignment between model recommendations and organizational strategy1285818205979465039 Executive hesitation in implementing solutions they dont understand128679 Barriers in stakeholder communication and buyin Challenges in crossfunctional collaborationOR practitioners face a dual communication burden They must translate business problems into mathematical models and explain complex solutions to stakeholders This challenge becomes harder when tools and methods lack transparencyUnderstanding how we arrived at this opacity is crucial for charting a path forward The historical development of OR has created structural barriers to transparency and recognizing these is the first step toward dismantling themHow did we get here128220 Historical reasonsThe foundations of modern ORs transparency challenges were laid during its golden age of software development 1980s1990s This period saw the emergence of powerful but closed systems that shaped the fields culture for decadesProprietary enterprisegrade solutions dominated the landscape across multiple domainsOptimization Solvers CPLEX FICO Xpress are powerful and complex environments that set the standard for opaque solutionsSimulation Tools SIMANArena Sophisticated but closed systems for process modelingDecision Support Systems Expert Choice are proprietary frameworks with undisclosed methodologiesSupply Chain Solutions i2 Technologies Industryspecific tools with embedded OR techniques in opaque interfacesSeveral interconnected factors reinforced this closed ecosystem128184 Economic realities those companies had high development costs so they needed to charge premium prices Limited market competition enabled exclusive business models128190 Technological context sharing software was harder then due to limited access to public repositories It was possible but impractical Computational constraints favored optimized closed implementations and hardware limitations made efficient proprietary solutions more viable Given the high computational complexities of OR solutions you need machines with i good CPU and ii good RAM Those are expensive128257 Academic vs industry both worlds have different incentive structures Universities need to publish papers and the more complicated the better while businesses prioritize practical implementation and simple solutions are often better Academic research incentives favored theoretical publications over opensource tools while enterprise software models prioritized exclusive highmargin solutions All of this contributes to limited transfer mechanisms between academia and industry12796365039 Cultural evolution OR professionals viewed methodological complexity as a competitive advantage It uses highly mathematical notation that sets another entry barrier Since each industry has its own optimization problems and almost every business has unique constraints OR is a fragmented field making genericpurpose software less appealingThis historical development had lasting consequences It delayed the democratization of OR tools reduced crossdisciplinary collaboration and slowed innovation compared to open fieldsWhile OR remained in its closed ecosystem ML evolved differentlyCan we learn from Machine Learning and restart Operations Research to make it greater than ever128161 Learning from Machine Learning a blueprint for transparencyMachine Learnings transparencyfirst approach offers valuable lessons for Operations ResearchWhile ML faces algorithmic opacity challenges the field has cultivated a culture of openness that drives innovation and adoptionI see three pillars of ML transparency128275 Open knowledge ecosystemThe codesharing culture with public repositories drives open research and a preprint culture for topnotch work on arXivThat opens a reproducible research environment with standard datasets and evaluation metricsPeer reviews go beyond traditional channels due to a communitydriven process129309 Democratized innovationYou can visit GitHub to find countless opensource repositories of tools like PyTorch TensorFlow or scikitlearn and educational resources like free courses tutorials and documentationThose platforms offer a discussion forum like GitHub Discussions for users to discuss important development tasks This fosters collaborative development128269 Transparency technologiesThough you may struggle to understand why a model gave a particular solution decision explanation tools like SHAP and LIME can helpThere are visualization tools like TensorBoard and Weights amp Biases to visualize the training process and final weights applicationAn ecosystem of tools like MLflow or Kubeflow helps manage the entire ML cycle including tracking experiments packaging code into reproducible runs and sharing and deploying models8594 The transformation of OR doesnt require abandoning its mathematical rigor or unique strengths Instead we can128207 Maintain precision while improving accessibility127891 Preserve expertise while broadening participation127981 Keep industrial applications while sharing general approaches128220 Honor historical contributions while embracing modern practicesWe can create a more vibrant accessible and innovative field by adopting MLs transparency practices while preserving ORs core strengths127937 Some conclusionsThe path forward is clear Operations Research must embrace transparency to reach its full potentialBut this transformation promises more than openness It offers a fundamental reimagining of how OR can drive business valueKey benefits of a transparent OR ecosystem128640 Accelerated innovation through opensource collaboration speeds development cycles and crosspollinates ideas This accelerates problemsolving through shared knowledge127775 Talent development and attraction to lower barriers for new practitioners with clear learning paths for aspiring OR professionals129309 Enhanced trust and adoption with a clearer value proposition for decisionmakers better stakeholder understanding of solutions and increased implementation confidence This resulted in stronger alignment with modern business practices127942 Competitive advantage with faster deployment of optimization solutions and

Men233ndez and here in Feasible I share my personal views on how Operations Research impacts our day to day businesses or society128200 Operations Research reimagined Part III mindsetThere exist a transparency issue lets fix itBorja Men233ndezNov 24nbspREAD IN APPnbspListen to post 2022Today8217s post is sponsored by8230The DecisionOps platform helping optimization teams build more decision models instead of more decision tools128073 Do you want to sponsor a post innbspFeasible Just reply to this emailA paradox exists in analytical solutions while Machine Learning and Operations Research aim to drive better decisions they take radically different approaches to transparencyOR holds a distinct advantage in terms of algorithmic clarityOur mathematical models state their objectives and constraints providing a clear path to understanding solutions Even in complex scenarios the logic remains traceable8212sometimes difficult to follow but fundamentally comprehensibleContrast this with MLs opaque algorithms Neural Networks and Transformers make decisions through complex layers that resist straightforward interpretation While explainability tools exist they require additional trust in their mechanismsHowever when we examine organizational culture and knowledgesharing practices the situation reverses dramaticallyML thrives in an opensource ecosystem where leading tools are freely available and communitydriven innovation is the norm This transparency has accelerated adoption with decisionmakers comfortable implementing ML solutionsOR remains bound to proprietary approaches The mathematical clarity of our solutions is hidden behind closed software and proprietary implementations limiting the fields accessibility and adoption128204 Why does this matter nowThis transparency gap isnt just an academic concern Its shaping the future of business analytics129488 Organizations are demanding explainable accessible solutions1281058205128187 The next generation of analysts and developers expect open tools and communities128176 Companies are making multimillion dollar decisions between OR and ML approaches128214 The rise of AI has made transparency essential for solution adoption1293358205979465039 The OR talent gap is widening while ML attracts new practitioners dailyUnderstanding this disconnect and its implications for ORs future is crucialIn todays Feasible edition well explore128373650398205979465039 The impact of ORs transparency issue128220 How historical decisions shaped our closed ecosystem128161 What we can learn from MLs transparent approachThis is the third post in a sixpart series on the issues that have prevented OR from reaching its full potential and help you avoid these patterns If you missed them read Part I and Part II127911 At the top you can listen to a podcastlike version of this post8594 Ready to dive into ORs transparency challenge Lets get started The problem with the lack of transparencyTrust is fundamental to adopting any analytical solutionIn Operations Research trust is critical because our solutions drive significant business decisions Yet our field often operates behind a veil of opacity that undermines this trustWhile OR prides itself on mathematical precision and optimal solutions the path to these solutions often remains hiddenProprietary solvers obscure their algorithms behind simplified interfaces creating a black box that decisionmakers struggle to trust This opacity creates a paradox we offer precise deterministic solutions but conceal the reasoning that makes them reliableAn interesting contrast emerges when comparing OR and Machine LearningWhile ML algorithms are more opaque in their decisionmaking they face less resistance in adoption The key lies in expectation managementML practitioners acknowledge the probabilistic nature of their solutions and have developed robust tools for decision explanation Meanwhile ORs promise of deterministic optimality creates higher expectations for solution transparencyThis lack of transparency manifests in several critical ways859665039 Misalignment between model recommendations and organizational strategy1285818205979465039 Executive hesitation in implementing solutions they dont understand128679 Barriers in stakeholder communication and buyin Challenges in crossfunctional collaborationOR practitioners face a dual communication burden They must translate business problems into mathematical models and explain complex solutions to stakeholders This challenge becomes harder when tools and methods lack transparencyUnderstanding how we arrived at this opacity is crucial for charting a path forward The historical development of OR has created structural barriers to transparency and recognizing these is the first step toward dismantling themHow did we get here128220 Historical reasonsThe foundations of modern ORs transparency challenges were laid during its golden age of software development 1980s1990s This period saw the emergence of powerful but closed systems that shaped the fields culture for decadesProprietary enterprisegrade solutions dominated the landscape across multiple domainsOptimization Solvers CPLEX FICO Xpress are powerful and complex environments that set the standard for opaque solutionsSimulation Tools SIMANArena Sophisticated but closed systems for process modelingDecision Support Systems Expert Choice are proprietary frameworks with undisclosed methodologiesSupply Chain Solutions i2 Technologies Industryspecific tools with embedded OR techniques in opaque interfacesSeveral interconnected factors reinforced this closed ecosystem128184 Economic realities those companies had high development costs so they needed to charge premium prices Limited market competition enabled exclusive business models128190 Technological context sharing software was harder then due to limited access to public repositories It was possible but impractical Computational constraints favored optimized closed implementations and hardware limitations made efficient proprietary solutions more viable Given the high computational complexities of OR solutions you need machines with i good CPU and ii good RAM Those are expensive128257 Academic vs industry both worlds have different incentive structures Universities need to publish papers and the more complicated the better while businesses prioritize practical implementation and simple solutions are often better Academic research incentives favored theoretical publications over opensource tools while enterprise software models prioritized exclusive highmargin solutions All of this contributes to limited transfer mechanisms between academia and industry12796365039 Cultural evolution OR professionals viewed methodological complexity as a competitive advantage It uses highly mathematical notation that sets another entry barrier Since each industry has its own optimization problems and almost every business has unique constraints OR is a fragmented field making genericpurpose software less appealingThis historical development had lasting consequences It delayed the democratization of OR tools reduced crossdisciplinary collaboration and slowed innovation compared to open fieldsWhile OR remained in its closed ecosystem ML evolved differentlyCan we learn from Machine Learning and restart Operations Research to make it greater than ever128161 Learning from Machine Learning a blueprint for transparencyMachine Learnings transparencyfirst approach offers valuable lessons for Operations ResearchWhile ML faces algorithmic opacity challenges the field has cultivated a culture of openness that drives innovation and adoptionI see three pillars of ML transparency128275 Open

Men233ndez and here in Feasible I share my personal views on how Operations Research impacts our day to day businesses or society128200 Operations Research reimagined Part III mindsetThere exist a transparency issue lets fix itBorja Men233ndezNov 24nbspREAD IN APPnbspListen to post 2022Today8217s post is sponsored by8230The DecisionOps platform helping optimization teams build more decision models instead of more decision tools128073 Do you want to sponsor a post innbspFeasible Just reply to this emailA paradox exists in analytical solutions while Machine Learning and Operations Research aim to drive better decisions they take radically different approaches to transparencyOR holds a distinct advantage in terms of algorithmic clarityOur mathematical models state their objectives and constraints providing a clear path to understanding solutions Even in complex scenarios the logic remains traceable8212sometimes difficult to follow but fundamentally comprehensibleContrast this with MLs opaque algorithms Neural Networks and Transformers make decisions through complex layers that resist straightforward interpretation While explainability tools exist they require additional trust in their mechanismsHowever when we examine organizational culture and knowledgesharing practices the situation reverses dramaticallyML thrives in an opensource ecosystem where leading tools are freely available and communitydriven innovation is the norm This transparency has accelerated adoption with decisionmakers comfortable implementing ML solutionsOR remains bound to proprietary approaches The mathematical clarity of our solutions is hidden behind closed software and proprietary implementations limiting the fields accessibility and adoption128204 Why does this matter nowThis transparency gap isnt just an academic concern Its shaping the future of business analytics129488 Organizations are demanding explainable accessible solutions1281058205128187 The next generation of analysts and developers expect open tools and communities128176 Companies are making multimillion dollar decisions between OR and ML approaches128214 The rise of AI has made transparency essential for solution adoption1293358205979465039 The OR talent gap is widening while ML attracts new practitioners dailyUnderstanding this disconnect and its implications for ORs future is crucialIn todays Feasible edition well explore128373650398205979465039 The impact of ORs transparency issue128220 How historical decisions shaped our closed ecosystem128161 What we can learn from MLs transparent approachThis is the third post in a sixpart series on the issues that have prevented OR from reaching its full potential and help you avoid these patterns If you missed them read Part I and Part II127911 At the top you can listen to a podcastlike version of this post8594 Ready to dive into ORs transparency challenge Lets get started The problem with the lack of transparencyTrust is fundamental to adopting any analytical solutionIn Operations Research trust is critical because our solutions drive significant business decisions Yet our field often operates behind a veil of opacity that undermines this trustWhile OR prides itself on mathematical precision and optimal solutions the path to these solutions often remains hiddenProprietary solvers obscure their algorithms behind simplified interfaces creating a black box that decisionmakers struggle to trust This opacity creates a paradox we offer precise deterministic solutions but conceal the reasoning that makes them reliableAn interesting contrast emerges when comparing OR and Machine LearningWhile ML algorithms are more opaque in their decisionmaking they face less resistance in adoption The key lies in expectation managementML practitioners acknowledge the probabilistic nature of their solutions and have developed robust tools for decision explanation Meanwhile ORs promise of deterministic optimality creates higher expectations for solution transparencyThis lack of transparency manifests in several critical ways859665039 Misalignment between model recommendations and organizational strategy1285818205979465039 Executive hesitation in implementing solutions they dont understand128679 Barriers in stakeholder communication and buyin Challenges in crossfunctional collaborationOR practitioners face a dual communication burden They must translate business problems into mathematical models and explain complex solutions to stakeholders This challenge becomes harder when tools and methods lack transparencyUnderstanding how we arrived at this opacity is crucial for charting a path forward The historical development of OR has created structural barriers to transparency and recognizing these is the first step toward dismantling themHow did we get here128220 Historical reasonsThe foundations of modern ORs transparency challenges were laid during its golden age of software development 1980s1990s This period saw the emergence of powerful but closed systems that shaped the fields culture for decadesProprietary enterprisegrade solutions dominated the landscape across multiple domainsOptimization Solvers CPLEX FICO Xpress are powerful and complex environments that set the standard for opaque solutionsSimulation Tools SIMANArena Sophisticated but closed systems for process modelingDecision Support Systems Expert Choice are proprietary frameworks with undisclosed methodologiesSupply Chain Solutions i2 Technologies Industryspecific tools with embedded OR techniques in opaque interfacesSeveral interconnected factors reinforced this closed ecosystem128184 Economic realities those companies had high development costs so they needed to charge premium prices Limited market competition enabled exclusive business models128190 Technological context sharing software was harder then due to limited access to public repositories It was possible but impractical Computational constraints favored optimized closed implementations and hardware limitations made efficient proprietary solutions more viable Given the high computational complexities of OR solutions you need machines with i good CPU and ii good RAM Those are expensive128257 Academic vs industry both worlds have different incentive structures Universities need to publish papers and the more complicated the better while businesses prioritize practical implementation and simple solutions are often better Academic research incentives favored theoretical publications over opensource tools while enterprise software models prioritized exclusive highmargin solutions All of this contributes to limited transfer mechanisms between academia and industry12796365039 Cultural evolution OR professionals viewed methodological complexity as a competitive advantage It uses highly mathematical notation that sets another entry barrier Since each industry has its own optimization problems and almost every business has unique constraints OR is a fragmented field making genericpurpose software less appealingThis historical development had lasting consequences It delayed the democratization of OR tools reduced crossdisciplinary collaboration and slowed innovation compared to open fieldsWhile OR remained in its closed ecosystem ML evolved differentlyCan we learn from Machine Learning and restart Operations Research to make it greater than ever128161 Learning from Machine Learning a blueprint for transparencyMachine Learnings transparencyfirst approach offers valuable lessons for Operations ResearchWhile ML faces algorithmic opacity challenges the field has cultivated a culture of openness that drives innovation and adoptionI see three pillars of ML transparency128275 Open knowledge ecosystemThe codesharing culture with public repositories drives open research and a preprint culture for topnotch work on arXivThat opens a reproducible research environment with standard datasets and evaluation metricsPeer reviews go beyond traditional channels due to a communitydriven process129309 Democratized innovationYou can visit GitHub to find countless opensource repositories of tools like PyTorch TensorFlow or scikitlearn and educational resources like free courses tutorials and documentationThose platforms offer a discussion forum like GitHub Discussions for users to discuss important development tasks This fosters collaborative development128269 Transparency technologiesThough you may struggle to understand why a model gave a particular solution decision explanation tools like SHAP and LIME can helpThere are visualization tools like TensorBoard and Weights amp Biases to visualize the training process and final weights applicationAn ecosystem of tools like MLflow or Kubeflow helps manage the entire ML cycle including tracking experiments packaging code into reproducible runs and sharing and deploying models8594 The transformation of OR doesnt require abandoning its mathematical rigor or unique strengths Instead we can128207 Maintain precision while improving accessibility127891 Preserve expertise while broadening participation127981 Keep industrial applications while sharing general approaches128220 Honor historical contributions while embracing modern practicesWe can create a more vibrant accessible and innovative field by adopting MLs transparency practices while preserving ORs core strengths127937 Some conclusionsThe path forward is clear Operations Research must embrace transparency to reach its full potentialBut this transformation promises more than openness It offers a fundamental reimagining of how OR can drive business valueKey benefits of a transparent OR ecosystem128640 Accelerated innovation through opensource collaboration speeds development cycles and crosspollinates ideas This accelerates problemsolving through shared knowledge127775 Talent development and attraction to lower barriers for new practitioners with clear learning paths for aspiring OR professionals129309 Enhanced trust and adoption with a clearer value proposition for decisionmakers better stakeholder understanding of solutions and increased implementation confidence This resulted in stronger alignment with modern business practices127942 Competitive advantage with faster deployment of optimization solutions and greater adaptability to new tech stacksThe transformation of OR is essential for the fields futureJoin the movement128214 Share your transparency success stories128187 Contribute to opensource OR

QT Classroom,quantra@quantinsti.com,row8 column2 block1paragraphblock tdpaddiv Learn the need and steps involved in optimising ML models for trading using Python EPATCoursesReviews Hi OmkarWelcome to todays Quantra Classroom Youve likely spent time building machine learning ML models and tweaking them to improve their accuracy However in trading optimization goes beyond just increasing accuracyits about finding the right balance between performance speed and risk management In todays classroom we will explore the optimization techniques for ML models These techniques and their implementation using Python are extensively covered in the Advanced Momentum Trading Machine Learning Strategies course on Quantra VIEW COURSE All the concepts covered in this email are taken from the Quantra course Advanced Momentum Trading Machine Learning Strategies You can preview the concepts taught in this classroom by clicking on the Start for Free button and going to Section and Unit of the course Note The links in this tutorial will be accessible only after logging into quantraquantinsticom Note that backtesting results do not guarantee future performance The presented results are intended solely for educational purposes and should not be interpreted as investment advice In this Quantra Classroom we will cover the following topics What is ML model optimization Why does model optimization matter in trading How to optimize machine learning models Avoiding common pitfalls in ML model tuning Optimizing ML models using Python If youre new to machine learning the Python for Machine Learning in Finance course would be a helpful starting point What is ML model optimization When we talk about model optimization were referring to the process of finetuning the parameters and structure of your machine learning model to improve its performance In trading model optimization is not just about squeezing out the highest accuracyits about creating a model that works in realtime and adapts well to everchanging market conditions Optimization methods aim to find that sweet spot where your model makes reliable predictions without being overly sensitive to random noise in the data For trading this means balancing the tradeoff between bias underfitting and variance overfitting to avoid creating a model that works well in backtesting but fails in live trading Figure Error due to Bias Error due to variance Why does model optimization matter in trading In trading model performance directly impacts your bottom line If your model is too complex it might overfit to historical data and perform poorly when you apply it to live markets Conversely if your model is too simple it might miss key opportunities Figure Comparison of Underfitting vs Overfitting Optimizing a machine learning model for trading helps it generalize well to unseen data which is essential for making consistent trades A welloptimized model can handle a wide range of market conditions and isnt easily thrown off by minor changes in market dynamics Simply put a welloptimized model can be the difference between a deployable trading strategy and one that fizzles out in live markets How to optimize machine learning models Lets get straight to the key questionhow exactly do you optimize a machinelearning model for trading Here are some key methods you can apply Grid Search and Random Search Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting the best set of parameters for a machine learning model to improve its performance In grid search you test every combination of hyperparameters exhaustively which works well for smaller datasets On the other hand random search is faster because it picks random combinations of parameters and tests them For trading random search is often preferred because its more timeefficient and doesnt result in sacrificing performance CrossValidation Crossvalidation is a must for optimizing ML models Typically you first split your data into training and testing sets where the model is trained on one part and evaluated on the other In crossvalidation however you divide your data into multiple folds where each fold takes turns being the test set while the others are used for training For example in 5fold crossvalidation the data is split into five equal parts and the model is trained and tested five times on different sections This helps ensure that your model isnt just learning the quirks of one particular data split and performs well across different portions of the dataset Regularization L1 and L2 Penalties Regularization methods like Lasso L1 and Ridge L2 are crucial in trading models because they prevent overfitting These techniques add a penalty for having overly complex models with large coefficients In simpler terms regularization helps simplify your model without sacrificing accuracy making it more adaptable to live markets Ensemble Methods In some cases relying on a single model just doesnt cut it Thats where ensemble methods like Voting Classifier come into play A Voting Classifier combines the predictions of multiple different modelssuch as decision trees logistic regression and SVMsto make a final decision based on the majority vote hard voting or the average predicted probabilities soft voting Avoiding common pitfalls in ML model tuning While optimizing your model its easy to fall into certain traps Heres how you can avoid them Overfitting As discussed above the biggest mistake in machine learning is overfittingmaking a model that works perfectly on historical data but fails on new data To prevent overfitting use techniques like crossvalidation regularization and testing your model across different market regimes Data Leakage Data leakage happens when information from your test data leaks into your training data causing the model to perform unnaturally well in backtesting but poorly in realtime This is a critical issue in trading models so make sure to properly split your data OverOptimization When you overoptimize your model becomes too sensitive to past data patterns that might not repeat In trading the market is always changing so building a flexible model that can adapt to new conditions is essential Test your model on different datasets and market regimes to ensure robustness Optimizing ML models using Python Optimizing machine learning models might sound complex but Python offers several libraries and tools to make it easier For example hyperparameters can be tuned in Python with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV functions These functions from scikitlearn library allow you to test multiple parameter combinations to find the one that delivers the best results We have covered hyperparameter optimization and other model optimization techniques in detail along with the Python code in the
